Hey, I'm Kudakwashe Mupeni, a passionate software developer from Zimbabwe. I’ve been a developer since 2015, and it’s been an exciting journey ever since. I’m a huge fan of _TypeScript, React, NodeJS, Vite, DevOps_, and all things _serverless_. But my blog isn’t just about tech — it's also a space for me to reflect on life and share some lessons I’ve learned along the way. Whether you’re here for cool tech ideas or personal stories, I hope you’ll find something that resonates with you. Let’s explore, learn, and grow together!
